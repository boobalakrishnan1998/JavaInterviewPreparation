NBFInstant:
The National Bank of Fujairah (NBF) in the United Arab Emirates has developed an instant account creation                application. This application consists of three modules:
This project by NBF aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for people in the UAE to open new bank accounts   without the need to visit a physical branch. The combination of self-service account creation and personalized     assistance from Relationship Managers makes the process more accessible to a broader range of customers.

Self Account Creation: Through this module, individuals can open or create new savings and current accounts             instantly. The application simplifies the account opening process, allowing applicants to do it themselves       without visiting a physical branch.

RM Account Creation: RM stands for Relationship Manager. In this module, the Relationship Manager is involved in the account creation process. They may assist customers who prefer personalized assistance in opening their accounts. This could be particularly helpful for more complex or specialized account requirements.

RM Application Verification: Once an applicant submits their account opening application, it is sent to the RM tab. The Relationship Manager then proceeds to verify the applicant's details. This verification process may involve physically visiting the applicant's location to confirm their identity and other necessary information.

 The feature allows investors to declare up to 3 nominees and specify their details, such as Nominee's name, date of birth, and  percentage. If any of the nominees are minors, their guardian details must be provided.

Nomination Status: After the investor submits the nominee details, the nomination status is set to "In progress." This indicates that the nomination declaration is currently being processed.

Updating Nominee Details: As a distributor, our role is to update the nominee details to the relevant Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs). In this case, there are two RTAs involved: KFinTech and CAMS.
I have implemented RESTful APIs to post the nominee details to both KFinTech and CAMS APIs.

Nominee Activation: Once the nominee details are successfully updated in the respective RTAs' systems, the nominated individuals are activated as the official nominees for the investor.

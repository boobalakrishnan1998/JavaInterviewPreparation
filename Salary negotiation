thank you so much, you making me offer and showing your trust in me,
   I have a couple of questions,
    I would like to talk about it, that's OK


Position Linked Benefits

i see here the annual fixed salary is  506444 based on research

i am just hoping for the 6LPA as fixed


what will be the my take home


But based on my research about the company and current market value and my experience skill set  I am expecting a salary more than in the range of 6 LPA

yeah okay, may I know when I got the next revision letter from your company?

it's almost 1 and a half years so u may consider my request.

Yes, I understood

i have to consider the my relocating expenses.

I have my next revision letter on coming September month I have to consider that also because I got a 35 % hike on last year this year I will get a minimum 40 % percentage hike if I consider from this currently your offering on 22 % only
